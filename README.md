## Getting Started

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To serve a specific environment run `ng serve --configuration [environment]`, for example: 
```
ng serve --configuration development
```

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

For production build use:
```
ng build --prod
```

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running unit tests with code coverage
Run `ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless --code-coverage` to execute the unit tests with code coverage via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Lint
Run `ng lint` 

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
